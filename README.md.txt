## Trader Behavior Insights – Market Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes how trader behavior and performance vary across
different market sentiment regimes (Fear and Greed) using historical
trader data from Hyperliquid and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.

The objective is to understand how profitability, leverage usage, and
risk management change with market sentiment and to identify patterns
that can inform smarter trading strategies.
